        <div class="section">
            3linear, my discord username. I am a part-time 3d modeler and a 3d animator. I currently do not wish to work for anyone, but I am selling IGCSE notes about science.
        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="section">
            I have been learning HTML and been practicing key-framing and 3d modeling. One issue a 3d modeler would have is creating complex shapes. Luckily, Blender is a really useful and versatile tool for modeling and other such things, such as animating. Sooner or later, I may start modeling as a part-time job.

        <div class="section">
            Currently, I have not added the IGCSE notes as I am still reviewing them. These notes are for science, for IGCSE, Thailand. Below, I will continue listing about the IGCSE notes.

            You can contact me on Discord, username 3linear. My timezone is GMT+8. You may also email me at alphastopmotion@gmail.com.

            As I said, I, at this time, would not want to be contracted for any 3d modeling. However, I will start posting videos explaining ways to do things related to modeling on YouTube. My handle is jeff29365.

            As for animating, in the near future, I may start offering contracts for animating. Though, at this time, I do not offer any form of contracts for animating or 3d modeling.

            IGCSE notes
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          IGCSE notes will be offered at fluctuating prices, so currently I will not put a price. One more thing to note is that different parts of science, i.e., chemistry and physics, are sold separately. Lastly, I offer a discount code "ALPHA" for the first 10 people who order a copy and use the discount. This is a limited offer and is a 10% discount. to head to the website, type nas.io/cosmicpanpan
