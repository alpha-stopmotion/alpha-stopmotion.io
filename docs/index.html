        <div class="section">
            3linear, my discord username. I am a part-time 3d modeler and a 3d animator. I currently do not wish to work for anyone, but I am selling IGCSE notes about science
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            I have been learning HTML and been practicing key-framing and 3d modeling. One issue a 3d modeler would have are creating complex shapes, luckily, blender is a really useful and versatile tools for modeling and other such things, such as animating. Sooner ir later I may start modeling as a part-time job.
        </div>
        <div class="section">
           Currently I have not added the IGCSE notes as, I am still reviewing them. These noted are for science, for IGCSE, Thailand. below I will continue listing about the IGCSE notes.

        <div class="section">
            As I said, I, at this time, would not want to be contracted for any 3d modeling, though, I will start posting videos explaining ways to do things related to modeling on youtube. My handle is jeff29365.
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            As for animating, In the near future I may start offering contracts for animating, though, at this time, I do not offer any form of contracts for animating or 3d modeling.

            IGCSE notes
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          IGCSE notes will be offered and fluctuating prices, so currently I will not put a price currently, One more thing to not is that for different parts of science i.e, chemistry, and or physics, they are sold seperatly. Lastly I offer a discount "ALPHA" for the first 10 people who order a copy and use the discount. This is an limitef offer and is a 10% discount.
